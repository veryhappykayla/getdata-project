## Introduction

This course project (for the Coursera [Getting and Cleaning Data](http://class.coursera.org/getdata-011) course, February 2015) demonstrates collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set -- in this case, the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

We wrote a script, run_analysis.R, which downloads data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and prepares from it tidy data for later analysis.

The original data is from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set:

... which is further described at:

The tidy data output can be seen in tidy_data.txt, and is described in codebook.md.
